# National Cyber Threat Assessment 2025-2026

The Canadian Cyber Centre has published their bi-annual report analyzing the current threat landscape[^website]. The article is elaborate in highlighting key APT sponsoring states, and other threats for the Canadian Cyber Landscape.  

The full article can be found in the PDF in this directory, or at the CCC[^website].

## APT states
China, Russia, and Iran still aim to challenge USA dominance in many domains, including cyber.  
- China's Cyber program is the biggest threat: aggressive TAs, and they are targeting all levels of government, public officials too.  
- Russian actors are unpredictable, using disinformation and espionage to aid in attacks. Their current conflict is a driver for Russian APTs.  
- Iranian APTs aim to aid in their conflict, but Canada is not likely to be targeted at present. Social engineering is key for them.  
- NK APTs target cryptocurrency theft via ransomware.  
- India APTs perform espionage for national security.  

## Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS)
Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) business models have been on the rise.  
- Malware, Ransomware, Access, Phishing, DDoS, and Exploits are all being offered as services via Clearweb Marketplaces, Dark/Deep web forums, and private chat platforms like Telegram.  
- Phishing, Fraud, and Scams are prevalent threats.  

## Ransomware
Ransomware remains the biggest threat, with payment sizes and the number of incidents on the rise with an average 26% YOY growth.  
- Targets include Energy, Healthcare, and Government.  
- Detection evasion is constant, with TAs evolving TTPs to hide. Law enforcement crackdowns are reducing effectiveness.  
- Key varieties include Lockbit, ALPHV, CL0P, Play, and Black Basta.  

## Industry Trends
The article also noted 5 key industry trends for the next 2 years.  
1. AI is opening a gate for more incidents by making social engineering attacks more effective and personalized, enhancing targeting via big data, and improving the quality and quantity of disinformation attacks (aka fake news)  
2. Detection evasion is evolving due to a reduction in attacker's dwell time. Living off the Land attacks are more popular.  
3. Global non-state actors are more prevalent. Hacktivists are extremely motivated and target critical infrastructure.  
4. Vendor concentration (i.e. Microsoft, Google, AWS) is rising, increasing concentrated exploitation opportunities (i.e. Crowdstrike again, but this time it's malicious).  
5. Dual-Use commercial services (i.e. GPS, Starlink) are a target for disruption. i.e. jamming, spoofing.

The Canadian threat landscape is complicated and evolving, making it hard to determine what must be done to properly defend against APTs. Luckily, the Canadian Cyber Centre just published their bi-annual cyber threat landscape report. The article is elaborate in highlighting key APT sponsoring states, and other threats.

TLDR:

- China, Russia, and Iran still aim to challenge USA dominance in many domains, including cyber.
- Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) business models have been on the rise. Watch out for phishing and scams!
- Ransomware remains the biggest threat, with payment sizes and the number of incidents on the rise with an average 26% YOY growth.
- AI enhances social engineering, making phishing more personalized and effective.
- Detection evasion is becoming a priority.
