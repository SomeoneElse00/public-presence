# Arch Experiment

Turns out Arch Linux Installs aren't that difficult if you follow the documentation. I wanted to challenge myself and try installing what I have referred to as the "final boss" of Linux distros, Arch. It seemed daunting at first, but the documentation at the [Arch Linux Organization's wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) is pretty good! I ran into a small snag at the end, but it was pretty much smooth sailing.  

I learned a bunch about the tasks that Linux installers are required to do, including package installs, partitioning, and making sure the bootloader gets installed and set up ðŸ™„. I have a full breakdown of the steps I took and how far I got on my [GitHub](). If your wanting to give it a shot yourself, plan for about a day of work if its on a VM.  

Alternatively, If you just want to play around in Arch and aren't looking to learn the install process, there are versions of Arch that come with an installer. The install process will be just like any other distro. You can also look for other Arch-based distros like EndeavourOS, CachyOS, and Manjaro Linux.
