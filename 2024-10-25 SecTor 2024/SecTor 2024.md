# SecTor 2024

I had the chance on Wednesday to attend my first Cybersecurity conference, [BlackHat](https://www.linkedin.com/company/black-hat/) [#SecTor2024](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=sector2024)! I was super excited to meet many of the top Cybersecurity firms in the country at the [Security Education Conference Toronto (SecTor)](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/941897/), and learn about some companies making amazing tools to make defenders' jobs easier.

The thing that blew me away about the conference was the amount of students who attended. As I was walking the show floor, I saw a couple of groups of local high school students who were given the day to roam around and learn. I also saw plenty of university and post-university students walking around to find their foothold within this quickly growing industry.

I left the conference with a desire to learn more, and to hone my skills further from what I have done with my Master's program. I'm planning to dig into more of my interests with a home lab and give you a glimpse into my successes, learning moments, and struggles. More to come!
